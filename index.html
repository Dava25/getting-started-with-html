    <p>Hello world !</p>
In this <em>short note</em> I going to try to explain that I got from <b>stage "0"</b>. <br> As you noticed my <b>English</b> pretty far from good but I do my best to describe my first experience <a href="www.udacity.com">here</a>. <br>
So briefly speaking I am so <b>excited</b> and ready to <b>learn</b>. <br> <em>In my opinion</em> the course is very interesting and <em><b>teachers</b></em> are good. So far I haven't some problems or gaps with course's material.<br> Thanks to <a href="www.udacity.com">all udacity community !</a>
